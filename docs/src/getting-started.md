# **2.** Getting Started

What follows is a quick overview of Pkg, Julia's package manager.
It should help new users become familiar with basic Pkg features.

## Basic Usage

Pkg comes with a REPL.
Enter the Pkg REPL by pressing `]` from the Julia REPL.
To get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace or ^C.

!!! note
    This guide relies on the Pkg REPL to execute Pkg commands.
    For non-interactive use, we recommend the Pkg API.
    The Pkg API is fully documented in the [API Reference](@ref) section of the Pkg documentation.

Upon entering the Pkg REPL, you should see a similar prompt:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg>
```

To add a package, use `add`:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> add Example
```

!!! note
    Some Pkg output has been omitted in order to keep this guide focused.
    This will help maintain a good pace and not get bogged down in details.
    If you require more details, refer to subsequent sections of the Pkg manual.

We can also specify multiple packages at once:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> add JSON StaticArrays
```

To remove packages, use `rm`:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> rm JSON StaticArrays
```

So far, we have referred only to registered packages.
Pkg also supports working with unregistered packages.
To add an unregistered package, specify a URL:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl
```

Use `rm` to remove this package by name:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> rm Example
```

Use `update` to update an installed package:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> update Example
```

To update all installed packages, use `update` without any arguments:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> update
```

## Getting Started with Environments

Up to this point, we have covered basic package management: adding, updating and removing packages.
This will be familiar if you have used other package managers.
Pkg offers significant advantages over traditional package managers
by organizing dependencies into **environments**.

You may have noticed the `(v1.1)` in the REPL prompt.
This lets us know `v1.1` is the **active environment**.
The active environment is the environment that will be modified by Pkg commands such as `add`, `rm` and `update`.

Let's set up a new environment so we may experiment.
To set the active environment, use `activate`:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> activate tutorial
[ Info: activating new environment at `~/tutorial/Project.toml`
```

Pkg lets us know we are creating a new environment and that this environment
will be stored in the `~/tutorial` directory.

Pkg has also updated the REPL prompt in order to reflect the new
active environment:

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg>
```

We can ask for information about the active environment by using `status`:

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg> status
    Status `~/tutorial/Project.toml`
   (empty environment)
```

`~/tutorial/Project.toml` is the location of the active environment's **project file**.
A project file is where Pkg stores metadata for an environment.
Notice this new environment is empty.
Let us add a package and observe:

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg> add Example
...

(tutorial) pkg> status
    Status `~/tutorial/Project.toml`
  [7876af07] Example v0.5.1
```

We can see `tutorial` now contains `Example` as a dependency.

## Modifying A Dependency

Say we are working on `Example` and feel it needs new functionality.
How can we modify the source code?
We can use `develop` to set up a git clone of the `Example` package.

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg> develop --local Example
...

(tutorial) pkg> status
    Status `~/tutorial/Project.toml`
  [7876af07] Example v0.5.1+ [`dev/Example`]
```

Notice the feedback has changed.
`dev/Example` refers to the location of the newly created clone.
If we look inside the `~/tutorial` directory, we will notice the following files:

```
tutorial
├── dev
│   └── Example
├── Manifest.toml
└── Project.toml
```

Instead of loading a registered version of `Example`,
Julia will load the source code contained in `tutorial/dev/Example`.

Let's try it out.
First we modify the file at `tutorial/dev/Example/src/Example.jl` and add a simple function:

```julia
plusone(x::Int) = x + 1
```

Now we can go back to the Julia REPL and load the package:

```julia-repl
julia> import Example
```

!!! warn
    A package can only be loaded once per Julia session.
    If you have run `import Example` in the current Julia session, you will
    have to restart Julia and rerun `activate tutorial` in the Pkg REPL.
    [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl/) can make this process
    significantly more pleasant, but setting it up is beyond the scope of this guide.

Julia should load our new code. Let's test it:

```julia-repl
julia> Example.plusone(1)
2
```

Say we have a change of heart and decide the world is not ready for such elegant code.
We can tell Pkg to stop using the local clone and use a registered version instead.
We do this with `free`:

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg> free Example
```

When you are done experimenting with `tutorial`, you can return to the **default
environment** by running `activate` with no arguments:

```julia-repl
(tutorial) pkg> activate

(v1.1) pkg>
```

## Asking for Help

If you are ever stuck, you can ask `Pkg` for help:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> ?
```

You should see a list of available commands along with short descriptions.
You can ask for more detailed help by specifying a command:

```julia-repl
(v1.1) pkg> ?develop
```

This guide should help you get started with `Pkg`.
