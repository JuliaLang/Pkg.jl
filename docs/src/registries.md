# **8.** Registries

Registries contain information about packages, such as
available releases and dependencies, and where they can be downloaded.
The [`General` registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General)
is the default one, and is installed automatically if there are no
other registries installed.

## Managing registries

Registries can be added, removed and updated from either the Pkg REPL
or by using the functional API. In this section we will describe the
REPL interface. The registry API is documented in
the [Registry API Reference](@ref) section.

### Adding registries

A custom registry can be added with the `registry add` command
from the Pkg REPL. Usually this will be done with a URL to the
registry.

If a custom registry has been installed causing the `General` registry
to not be automatically installed, it is easy to add it manually:


```julia-repl
pkg> registry add General
```

and now all the packages registered in `General` are available for e.g. adding.
To see which registries are currently installed you can use the `registry status`
(or `registry st`) command

```julia-repl
pkg> registry st
Registry Status
 [23338594] General (https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git)
```

Registries are always added to the user depot, which is the first entry in `DEPOT_PATH` (cf. the [Glossary](@ref) section).

!!! note "Registries from a package server"

    It is possible for a package server to be advertising additional available package
    registries. When Pkg runs with a clean Julia depot (e.g. after a fresh install), with
    a custom package server configured with `JULIA_PKG_SERVER`, it will automatically
    add all such available registries. If the depot already has some registries installed
    (e.g. General), the additional ones can easily be installed with the no-argument
    `registry add` command.

### Removing registries

Registries can be removed with the `registry remove` (or `registry rm`) command.
Here we remove the `General` registry

```julia-repl
pkg> registry rm General
  Removing registry `General` from ~/.julia/registries/General

pkg> registry st
Registry Status
  (no registries found)
```

In case there are multiple registries named `General` installed you have to
disambiguate with the `uuid`, just as when manipulating packages, e.g.

```julia-repl
pkg> registry rm General=23338594-aafe-5451-b93e-139f81909106
  Removing registry `General` from ~/.julia/registries/General
```

### Updating registries

The `registry update` (or `registry up`) command is available to update registries.
Here we update the `General` registry:

```julia-repl
pkg> registry up General
  Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
  Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General`
```

and to update all installed registries just do:

```julia-repl
pkg> registry up
  Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
  Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General`
```

Registries automatically update once per session when a package operation is performed so it
rarely has to be done manually.

## Registry format

In a registry, each package gets its own directory; in that directory
are the following files: `Compat.toml`, `Deps.toml`, `Package.toml`,
and `Versions.toml`.
The formats of these files are described below.

### Registry Compat.toml

The `Compat.toml` file has a series of blocks specifying version
numbers, with a set of dependencies listed below. For example,
part of such a file might look like this:

```toml
["0.8-0.8.3"]
DependencyA = "0.4-0.5"
DependencyB = "0.3-0.5"

["0.8.2-0.8.5"]
DependencyC = "0.7-0"
```

Dependencies that are unchanged across a range of versions are grouped
together in these blocks. The interpretation of these ranges is given by the comment after each line below:

```toml
"0.7-0.8"  # [0.7.0, 0.9.0)
"0.7-0"    # [0.7.0, 1.0.0)
"0.8.6-0"  # [0.8.6, 1.0.0)
"0.7-*"    # [0.7.0, âˆž)
```

So for this package, versions `[0.8.0, 0.8.3]` depend on versions `[0.4.0, 0.6.0)` of `DependencyA` and version `[0.3.0, 0.6.0)` of `DependencyB`.
Meanwhile, it is also true that versions `[0.8.2, 0.8.5]` require specific versions of `DependencyC` (so that all three are required for versions `0.8.2` and `0.8.3`).

### Registry formats

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Compressed registry formats are available starting with Julia 1.7.

Registries can be installed in several different formats, each with different tradeoffs:

#### Compressed registries (preferred)

When using a package server (the default), registries are downloaded as compressed tarballs. This is the preferred format for the General registry because it is:
- **Fast for the initial download**: Only a single compressed file needs to be transferred
- **Fast to use**: Pkg reads data directly from the packed tarball, avoiding many small filesystem reads
- **Low disk usage**: The registry can be read directly from the compressed file without extraction

You can check if a registry is compressed by running `Pkg.Registry.status()`, which will describe it as a "packed registry" when it remains in its tarball and an "unpacked registry" when the files have been extracted to disk.

#### Git registries

Registries can also be installed as git clones. This format:
- **Provides immediate updates**: Running `Pkg.Registry.update()` fetches the latest changes directly from the git repository
- **Uses more disk space**: The full git history is stored locally
- **May be slower**: Cloning and updating can take longer than downloading a compressed tarball
- **Integrates with local tooling**: All registry files are present on disk, so you can inspect or customize them using familiar editors and git workflows

To install a registry as a git clone, use:

```julia
Pkg.Registry.add(url = "https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git")
```

#### Converting between formats

To convert an existing registry from git to compressed (or vice versa), remove and re-add it:

```julia-repl
# Convert to compressed (uses package server if available)
pkg> registry rm General

pkg> registry add General

# Convert to git
pkg> registry rm General

pkg> registry add https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git
```

!!! note
    The environment variable `JULIA_PKG_SERVER` controls whether package servers are used. Setting it to an empty string (`JULIA_PKG_SERVER=""`) disables package server usage and forces git clones. To force unpacking even when using a package server, set `JULIA_PKG_UNPACK_REGISTRY=true`.

### `Package.toml` metadata

Each package directory within a registry contains a `Package.toml` file with static metadata about the package.
Typical keys include:

- `name`: the package name.
- `uuid`: the package UUID.
- `repo`: an optional URL pointing to the canonical source repository.
- `subdir`: an optional subdirectory within that repository containing the package.

#### `trusted_registries` {#trusted-registries}

To prevent "dependency confusion" style attacks, registries can record which other registries they explicitly trust
for a given `(name, uuid)` pair. Set the `trusted_registries` key in `Package.toml` to a single UUID string or an
array of UUID strings:

```toml
trusted_registries = [
    "23338594-aafe-5451-b93e-139f81909106", # General
    "e9fceed0-5623-4384-aff0-6db4c442647a", # Private registry
]
```

When two registries contain the same package, both must list one another in `trusted_registries` for Pkg to treat
the pairing as safe. If a manifest encounters a new registry for a package that lacks mutual trust entries,
Pkg records the metadata but emits a warning so that maintainers can investigate before escalating to an error
in a future release. For diagnostic sessions, you can temporarily opt out of the warning with
`Pkg.allow_registry_extension(true)` or by exporting the environment variable
`JULIA_PKG_ALLOW_REGISTRY_EXTENSION=true`. The override confirms the additional registry and writes it to the
manifest; if you later decide that registry should not remain trusted, undo the manifest change before
disabling the override again.

### Registry flavors

The default Pkg Server (`pkg.julialang.org`) offers two different "flavors" of registry.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Registry flavors are only available starting with Julia 1.8.

- `conservative`: suitable for most users; all packages and artifacts in this registry flavor are available from the Pkg Server, with no need to download from other sources
- `eager`: this registry offers the latest versions of packages, even if the Pkg and Storage Servers have not finished processing them; thus, some packages and artifacts may not be available from the Pkg Server, and thus may need to be downloaded from other sources (such as GitHub)

The default registry flavor is `conservative`. We recommend that most users stick to the `conservative` flavor unless they know that they need to use the `eager` flavor.

To select the `eager` flavor:

```julia
ENV["JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE"] = "eager"

import Pkg

Pkg.Registry.update()
```

To select the `conservative` flavor:

```julia
ENV["JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE"] = "conservative"

import Pkg

Pkg.Registry.update()
```

### Creating and maintaining registries

Pkg only provides client facilities for registries, rather than functionality to create
or maintain them. However, [Registrator.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl)
and [LocalRegistry.jl](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) provide ways to
create and update registries, and [RegistryCI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/RegistryCI.jl)
provides automated testing and merging functionality for maintaining a registry.
