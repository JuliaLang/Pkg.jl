Remove package `pkg` from the project file. Since the name `pkg` can only
refer to one package in a project this is unambiguous, but you can specify
a `uuid` anyway, and the command is ignored, with a warning, if package name
and UUID do not match. When a package is removed from the project file, it
may still remain in the manifest if it is required by some other package in
the project. Project mode operation is the default, so passing `-p` or
`--project` is optional unless it is preceded by the `-m` or `--manifest`
options at some earlier point. All packages can be removed by passing `--all`.

    [rm|remove] [-m|--manifest] pkg[=uuid] ...
    [rm|remove] [-m|--manifest] [--all]

Remove package `pkg` from the manifest file. If the name `pkg` refers to
multiple packages in the manifest, `uuid` disambiguates it. Removing a package
from the manifest forces the removal of all packages that depend on it, as well
as any no-longer-necessary manifest packages due to project package removals.
All packages can be removed by passing `--all`.

    add [--preserve=<opt>] pkg[=uuid] [@version] [#rev] ...

Add package `pkg` to the current project file. If `pkg` could refer to
multiple different packages, specifying `uuid` allows you to disambiguate.
`@version` optionally allows specifying which versions of packages to add. Version specifications
are of the form `@1`, `@1.2` or `@1.2.3`, allowing any version with a prefix
that matches, or ranges thereof, such as `@1.2-3.4.5`. A git revision can be
specified by `#branch` or `#commit`.

If a local path is used as an argument to `add`, the path needs to be a git repository.
The project will then track that git repository just like it would track a remote repository online.
If the package is not located at the top of the git repository, a subdirectory can be specified with
`path:subdir/path`.

`Pkg` resolves the set of packages in your environment using a tiered approach.
The `--preserve` command line option allows you to key into a specific tier in the resolve algorithm.
The following table describes the command line arguments to `--preserve` (in order of strictness).

| Argument | Description                                                                         |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all`    | Preserve the state of all existing dependencies (including recursive dependencies)  |
| `direct` | Preserve the state of all existing direct dependencies                              |
| `semver` | Preserve semver-compatible versions of direct dependencies                          |
| `none`   | Do not attempt to preserve any version information                                  |
| `tiered` | Use the tier which will preserve the most version information (this is the default) |

After the installation of new packages the project will be precompiled. For more information see `pkg> ?precompile`.

Make a package available for development. If `pkg` is an existing local path, that path will be recorded in
the manifest and used. Otherwise, a full git clone of `pkg` is made. The location of the clone is
controlled by the `--shared` (default) and `--local` arguments. The `--shared` location defaults to
`~/.julia/dev`, but can be controlled with the `JULIA_PKG_DEVDIR` environment variable.

When `--local` is given, the clone is placed in a `dev` folder in the current project. This
is not supported for paths, only registered packages.

This operation is undone by `free`.

new versions available, but cannot be installed due to compatibility
constraints. To see why use `pkg> status --outdated` which shows any packages
that are not at their latest version and if any packages are holding them back.

Use `pkg> status --extensions` to show dependencies with extensions and what extension dependencies
of those that are currently loaded.

In `--project` mode (default), the status of the project file is summarized. In `--manifest`
mode the output also includes the recursive dependencies of added packages given in the manifest.
