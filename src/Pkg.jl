    Pkg.add(pkg::Union{String, Vector{String}}; preserve=PRESERVE_TIERED)
    Pkg.add(pkg::Union{PackageSpec, Vector{PackageSpec}}; preserve=PRESERVE_TIERED)

Add a package to the current project. This package will be available by using the
`import` and `using` keywords in the Julia REPL, and if the current project is
a package, also inside that package.

## Resolution Tiers
`Pkg` resolves the set of packages in your environment using a tiered algorithm.
The `preserve` keyword argument allows you to key into a specific tier in the resolve algorithm.
The following table describes the argument values for `preserve` (in order of strictness):

| Value             | Description                                                                         |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PRESERVE_ALL`    | Preserve the state of all existing dependencies (including recursive dependencies)  |
| `PRESERVE_DIRECT` | Preserve the state of all existing direct dependencies                              |
| `PRESERVE_SEMVER` | Preserve semver-compatible versions of direct dependencies                          |
| `PRESERVE_NONE`   | Do not attempt to preserve any version information                                  |
| `PRESERVE_TIERED` | Use the tier which will preserve the most version information (this is the default) |

# Examples
```julia
Pkg.add("Example") # Add a package from registry
Pkg.add("Example"; preserve=Pkg.PRESERVE_ALL) # Add the `Example` package and preserve existing dependencies
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="Example", version="0.3")) # Specify version; latest release in the 0.3 series
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="Example", version="0.3.1")) # Specify version; exact release

    you can use `Pkg.API.precompile()` or the `precompile` Pkg REPL command.

Remove a package from the current project. If the `mode` of `pkg` is

recursive dependencies of `pkg`.

See also [`PackageSpec`](@ref), [`PackageMode`](@ref).

Update a package `pkg`. If no posistional argument is given, update all packages in the manifest if `mode` is `PKGMODE_MANIFEST` and packages in both manifest and project if `mode` is `PKGMODE_PROJECT`.
If no positional argument is given, `level` can be used to control by how much packages are allowed to be upgraded (major, minor, patch, fixed).

"""
    Pkg.test(; kwargs...)
    Pkg.test(pkg::Union{String, Vector{String}; kwargs...)

**Keyword arguments:**
  - `coverage::Bool=false`: enable or disable generation of coverage statistics.
  - `julia_args::Union{Cmd, Vector{String}}`: options to be passed the test process.
  - `test_args::Union{Cmd, Vector{String}}`: test arguments (`ARGS`) available in the test process.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `julia_args` and `test_args` requires at least Julia 1.3.

Run the tests for package `pkg`, or for the current project (which thus needs to be a package) if no
positional argument is given to `Pkg.test`. A package is tested by running its
`test/runtests.jl` file.

The tests are run by generating a temporary environment with only `pkg` and its (recursive) dependencies
in it. If a manifest exists, the versions in that manifest are used, otherwise
a feasible set of packages is resolved and installed.

During the tests, test-specific dependencies are active, which are
given in the project file as e.g.

```
[extras]
Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"

[targets]
test = ["Test"]
```

The tests are executed in a new process with `check-bounds=yes` and by default `startup-file=no`.
If using the startup file (`~/.julia/config/startup.jl`) is desired, start julia with `--startup-file=yes`.
Inlining of functions during testing can be disabled (for better coverage accuracy)
by starting julia with `--inline=no`.
"""

Garbage collect packages that are no longer reachable from any project.

that might contain local changes are touched.

Run the build script in `deps/build.jl` for `pkg` and all of its dependencies in
depth-first recursive order.
If no argument is given to `build`, the current project is built, which thus needs
to be a package.
This function is called automatically on any package that gets installed

"""
    Pkg.pin(pkg::Union{String, Vector{String}})

Pin a package to the current version (or the one given in the `PackageSpec`) or to a certain
git revision. A pinned package is never updated.

# Examples
```julia
Pkg.pin("Example")
Pkg.pin(PackageSpec(name="Example", version="0.3.1"))
```
"""

"""

e.g. after [`Pkg.develop`](@ref), go back to tracking registered versions.

# Examples
```julia
Pkg.free("Package")
Pkg.free(PackageSpec("Package"))
```
"""

"""
    Pkg.develop(pkg::Union{String, Vector{String}})

Make a package available for development by tracking it by path.
If `pkg` is given with only a name or by a URL, the package will be downloaded
to the location specified by the environment variable `JULIA_PKG_DEVDIR`, with
`.julia/dev` as the default.

If `pkg` is given as a local path, the package at that path will be tracked.

    Pkg.activate([s::String]; shared::Bool=false)

Activate the environment at `s`. The active environment is the environment
that is modified by executing package commands.
The logic for what path is activated is as follows:

  * If `shared` is `true`, the first existing environment named `s` from the depots
    in the depot stack will be activated. If no such environment exists,
    create and activate that environment in the first depot.
  * If `s` is an existing path, then activate the environment at that path.
  * If `s` is a package in the current project and `s` is tracking a path, then
    activate the environment at the tracked path.
  * Otherwise, `s` is interpreted as a non-existing path, which is then activated.

If no argument is given to `activate`, then activate the home project.
The home project is specified by either the `--project` command line option to
the julia executable, or the `JULIA_PROJECT` environment variable.

```

Pkg.activate("MyDependency")

A `PackageSpec` is a representation of a package with various metadata.
This includes:

  * The `name` of the package.
  * The package's unique `uuid`.
  * A `version` (for example when adding a package). When upgrading, can also be an instance of
   the enum [`UpgradeLevel`](@ref).
  * A `url` and an optional git `rev`ision. `rev` can be a branch name or a git commit SHA1.
  * A local `path`. This is equivalent to using the `url` argument but can be more descriptive.
  * A `mode`, which is an instance of the enum [`PackageMode`](@ref), with possible values `PKGMODE_PROJECT`
   (the default) or `PKGMODE_MANIFEST`. Used in e.g. [`Pkg.rm`](@ref).

Most functions in Pkg take a `Vector` of `PackageSpec` and do the operation on all the packages
in the vector.
