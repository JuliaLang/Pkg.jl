    Pkg.add(pkg::Union{String, Vector{String}}; preserve=PRESERVE_TIERED)
    Pkg.add(pkg::Union{PackageSpec, Vector{PackageSpec}}; preserve=PRESERVE_TIERED)

Add a package to the current project. This package will be available by using the
`import` and `using` keywords in the Julia REPL, and if the current project is
a package, also inside that package.

If the active environment is a package (the Project has both `name` and `uuid` fields) compat entries will be
added automatically with a lower bound of the added version.

## Resolution Tiers
`Pkg` resolves the set of packages in your environment using a tiered algorithm.
The `preserve` keyword argument allows you to key into a specific tier in the resolve algorithm.
The following table describes the argument values for `preserve` (in order of strictness):

| Value                       | Description                                                                        |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED`    | Like `PRESERVE_ALL` and only add those already installed                           |
| `PRESERVE_ALL`              | Preserve the state of all existing dependencies (including recursive dependencies) |
| `PRESERVE_DIRECT`           | Preserve the state of all existing direct dependencies                             |
| `PRESERVE_SEMVER`           | Preserve semver-compatible versions of direct dependencies                         |
| `PRESERVE_NONE`             | Do not attempt to preserve any version information                                 |
| `PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED` | Like `PRESERVE_TIERED` except `PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED` is tried first              |
| `PRESERVE_TIERED`           | Use the tier that will preserve the most version information while                 |
|                             | allowing version resolution to succeed (this is the default)                       |

!!! note
    To change the default strategy to `PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED` set the env var `JULIA_PKG_PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED`
    to true.

After the installation of new packages the project will be precompiled. For more information see `pkg> ?precompile`.

With the `PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED` strategy the newly added packages will likely already be precompiled, but if not this
may be because either the combination of package versions resolved in this environment has not been resolved and
precompiled before, or the precompile cache has been deleted by the LRU cache storage
(see `JULIA_MAX_NUM_PRECOMPILE_FILES`).

!!! compat "Julia 1.9"
    The `PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED` and `PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED` strategies requires at least Julia 1.9.

# Examples
```julia
Pkg.add("Example") # Add a package from registry
Pkg.add("Example"; preserve=Pkg.PRESERVE_ALL) # Add the `Example` package and strictly preserve existing dependencies
Pkg.add(name="Example", version="0.3") # Specify version; latest release in the 0.3 series
Pkg.add(name="Example", version="0.3.1") # Specify version; exact release
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl", rev="master") # From url to remote gitrepo

    Pkg.precompile(pkg; strict::Bool=false, timing::Bool=false)
    Pkg.precompile(pkgs; strict::Bool=false, timing::Bool=false)

Precompile all or specific dependencies of the project in parallel.

Set `timing=true` to show the duration of the precompilation of each dependency.

!!! note
    Errors will only throw when precompiling the top-level dependencies, given that
    not all manifest dependencies may be loaded by the top-level dependencies on the given system.
    This can be overridden to make errors in all dependencies throw by setting the kwarg `strict` to `true`

!!! note
    This method is called automatically after any Pkg action that changes the manifest.
    Any packages that have previously errored during precompilation won't be retried in auto mode
    until they have changed. To disable automatic precompilation set `ENV["JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO"]=0`.

If no positional argument is given, `level` can be used to control by how much packages are allowed to be upgraded (major, minor, patch, fixed).

- `PRESERVE_DIRECT`: Only allow `pkg` and indirect dependencies that are not a direct dependency in the project to update.
- `PRESERVE_NONE`: Allow `pkg` and all its indirect dependencies to update.

After any package updates the project will be precompiled. See more at [Environment Precompilation](@ref).

**Keyword arguments:**
  - `coverage::Bool=false`: enable or disable generation of coverage statistics.
  - `allow_reresolve::Bool=true`: allow Pkg to reresolve the package versions in the test environment
  - `julia_args::Union{Cmd, Vector{String}}`: options to be passed the test process.
  - `test_args::Union{Cmd, Vector{String}}`: test arguments (`ARGS`) available in the test process.

!!! compat "Julia 1.9"
    `allow_reresolve` requires at least Julia 1.9.

Run the tests for package `pkg`, or for the current project (which thus needs to be a package) if no
positional argument is given to `Pkg.test`. A package is tested by running its
`test/runtests.jl` file.

The tests are run by generating a temporary environment with only the `pkg` package
and its (recursive) dependencies in it. If a manifest file exists and the `allow_reresolve`
keyword argument is set to `false`, the versions in the manifest file are used.
Otherwise a feasible set of packages is resolved and installed.

During the tests, test-specific dependencies are active, which are
given in the project file as e.g.

```
[extras]
Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"

[targets]
test = ["Test"]
```

The tests are executed in a new process with `check-bounds=yes` and by default `startup-file=no`.
If using the startup file (`~/.julia/config/startup.jl`) is desired, start julia with `--startup-file=yes`.
Inlining of functions during testing can be disabled (for better coverage accuracy)
by starting julia with `--inline=no`. The tests can be run as if different command line arguments were
passed to julia by passing the arguments instead to the `julia_args` keyword argument, e.g.

```
Pkg.test("foo"; julia_args=["--inline"])
```

To pass some command line arguments to be used in the tests themselves, pass the arguments to the
`test_args` keyword argument. These could be used to control the code being tested, or to control the
tests in some way. For example, the tests could have optional additional tests:
```
if "--extended" in ARGS
    @test some_function()
end
```
which could be enabled by testing with
```
Pkg.test("foo"; test_args=["--extended"])
```

Pin a package to the current version (or the one given in the `PackageSpec`) or to a certain

Make a package available for development by tracking it by path.

Print out the status of the project/manifest.

Packages marked with `⌃` have new versions that can be installed, e.g. via [`Pkg.update`](@ref).
Those marked with `⌅` have new versions available, but cannot be installed due to compatibility conflicts with other packages. To see why, set the
keyword argument `outdated=true`.

Setting `outdated=true` will only show packages that are not on the latest version,
their maximum version and why they are not on the latest version (either due to other
packages holding them back due to compatibility constraints, or due to compatibility in the project file).
As an example, a status output like:
```
pkg> Pkg.status(; outdated=true)
Status `Manifest.toml`
⌃ [a8cc5b0e] Crayons v2.0.0 [<v3.0.0], (<v4.0.4)
⌅ [b8a86587] NearestNeighbors v0.4.8 (<v0.4.9) [compat]
⌅ [2ab3a3ac] LogExpFunctions v0.2.5 (<v0.3.0): SpecialFunctions
```
means that the latest version of Crayons is 4.0.4 but the latest version compatible
with the `[compat]` section in the current project is 3.0.0.
The latest version of NearestNeighbors is 0.4.9 but due to compat constrains in the project
it is held back to 0.4.8.
The latest version of LogExpFunctions is 0.3.0 but SpecialFunctions
is holding it back to 0.2.5.

If `mode` is `PKGMODE_PROJECT`, print out status only about the packages
that are in the project (explicitly added). If `mode` is `PKGMODE_MANIFEST`,
print status also about those in the manifest (recursive dependencies). If there are
any packages listed as arguments, the output will be limited to those packages.

Setting `ext=true` will show dependencies with extensions and what extension dependencies
of those that are currently loaded.

Setting `diff=true` will, if the environment is in a git repository, limit
the output to the difference as compared to the last git commit.

If no argument is given to `activate`, then use the first project found in `LOAD_PATH`

`@v#.#` environment.

    Pkg.offline(b::Bool=true)

Enable (`b=true`) or disable (`b=false`) offline mode.

In offline mode Pkg tries to do as much as possible without connecting
to internet. For example, when adding a package Pkg only considers
versions that are already downloaded in version resolution.

To work in offline mode across Julia sessions you can
set the environment variable `JULIA_PKG_OFFLINE` to `"true"`.

    Pkg.respect_sysimage_versions(b::Bool=true)

Enable (`b=true`) or disable (`b=false`) respecting versions that are in the
sysimage (enabled by default).

If this option is enabled, Pkg will only install packages that have been put into the sysimage
(e.g. via PackageCompiler) at the version of the package in the sysimage.
Also, trying to add a package at a URL or `develop` a package that is in the sysimage

    PackageSpec(name::String, [uuid::UUID, version::VersionNumber])
    PackageSpec(; name, url, path, subdir, rev, version, mode, level)

A `PackageSpec` is a representation of a package with various metadata.
This includes:

  * The `name` of the package.
  * The package's unique `uuid`.
  * A `version` (for example when adding a package). When upgrading, can also be an instance of
    the enum [`UpgradeLevel`](@ref). If the version is given as a `String` this means that unspecified versions
    are "free", for example `version="0.5"` allows any version `0.5.x` to be installed. If given as a `VersionNumber`,
    the exact version is used, for example `version=v"0.5.3"`.
  * A `url` and an optional git `rev`ision. `rev` can be a branch name or a git commit SHA1.
  * A local `path`. This is equivalent to using the `url` argument but can be more descriptive.
  * A `subdir` which can be used when adding a package that is not in the root of a repository.

Most functions in Pkg take a `Vector` of `PackageSpec` and do the operation on all the packages
in the vector.

Many functions that take a `PackageSpec` or a `Vector{PackageSpec}` can be called with a more concise notation with `NamedTuple`s.
For example, `Pkg.add` can be called either as the explicit or concise versions as:

| Explicit                                                            | Concise                                        |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="Package"))`                              | `Pkg.add(name = "Package")`                    |
| `Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="www.myhost.com/MyPkg")))`                 | `Pkg.add(name = "Package")`                    |
|` Pkg.add([PackageSpec(name="Package"), PackageSpec(path="/MyPkg"])` | `Pkg.add([(;name="Package"), (;path="MyPkg")])`|

| `REPL`               | `API`                                                 |

Set the protocol used to access hosted packages when `add`ing a url or `develop`ing a package.
Defaults to delegating the choice to the package developer (`protocol === nothing`).
Other choices for `protocol` are `"https"` or `"git"`.

# Examples
```julia-repl

A `RegistrySpec` is a representation of a registry with various metadata, much like

    upgrade_manifest()

Upgrades the format of the current or specified manifest file from v1.0 to v2.0 without re-resolving.

"""
    is_manifest_current(path::AbstractString)

Returns whether the manifest for the project at `path` was resolved from the current project file.
For instance, if the project had compat entries changed, but the manifest wasn't re-resolved, this would return false.

If the manifest doesn't have the project hash recorded, or if there is no manifest file, `nothing` is returned.

This function can be used in tests to verify that the manifest is synchronized with the project file:
