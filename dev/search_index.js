To enable this, Pkg supports a per-depot Overrides.toml file placed within the artifacts depot directory (e.g. ~/.julia/artifacts/Overrides.toml for the default user depot) that can override the location of an artifact either by content-hash or by package UUID and bound artifact name.

Instead, Gadfly, PyPlot, Winston and other packages each implement a unique approach based on a particular design philosophy.\nIn contrast, SortingAlgorithms provides a consistent interface to use many well-established sorting algorithms.\nPackages that wrap external libraries or programs can be named after those libraries or programs.\nCPLEX.jl wraps the CPLEX library, which can be identified easily in a web search.\nMATLAB.jl provides an interface to call the MATLAB engine from within Julia.\nAvoid naming a package closely to an existing package\nWebsocket is too close to WebSockets and can be confusing to users. Rather use a new name such as SimpleWebsockets.\nAvoid using a distinctive name that is already in use in a well known, unrelated project.\nDon't use the names Tkinter.jl, TkinterGUI.jl, etc. for a package that is unrelated to the popular tkinter python package, even if it provides bindings to Tcl/Tk. A package name of Tkinter.jl would only be appropriate if the package used Python's library to accomplish its work or was spearheaded by the same community of developers.\nIt's okay to name a package HTTP.jl even though it is unrelated to the popular rust crate http because in most usages the name \"http\" refers to the hypertext transfer protocol, not to the http rust crate.\nIt's okay to name a package OpenSSL.jl if it provides an interface to the OpenSSL library, even without explicit affiliation with the creators of the OpenSSL (provided there's no copyright or trademark infringement etc.)\nPackages should follow the Stylistic Conventions.\nThe package name should begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown with upper camel case\nPackages that provide the functionality of a project from another language should use the Julia convention\nPackages that provide pre-built libraries and executables can keep their original name, but should get _jllas a suffix.

Prefer artifacts over attempting to open a file via a path such as joinpath(@__DIR__, \"data\", \"my_dataset.csv\") as this is non-relocatable. Once your package has been precompiled, the result of @__DIR__ will have been baked into your precompiled package data, and if you attempt to distribute this package, it will attempt to load files at the wrong location. Artifacts can be bundled and accessed easily using the artifact\"name\" string macro.\nScratch.jl provides the notion of \"scratch spaces\", mutable containers of data for packages. Scratch spaces are designed for data caches that are completely managed by a package and should be removed when the package itself is uninstalled. For important user-generated data, packages should continue to write out to a user-specified path that is not managed by Julia or Pkg.\nPreferences.jl allows packages to read and write preferences to the top-level Project.toml.

Introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"Throughout the manual the REPL interface to Pkg, the Pkg REPL mode, is used in the examples. There is also a functional API, which is preferred when not working interactively. This API is documented in the API Reference section.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Background-and-Design","page":"1. Introduction","title":"Background and Design","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"1. Introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages, Pkg is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name. The exact set of packages and versions in an environment is captured in a manifest file which can be checked into a project repository and tracked in version control, significantly improving reproducibility of projects. If you’ve ever tried to run code you haven’t used in a while only to find that you can’t get anything to work because you’ve updated or uninstalled some of the packages your project was using, you’ll understand the motivation for this approach. In Pkg, since each project maintains its own independent set of package versions, you’ll never have this problem again. Moreover, if you check out a project on a new system, you can simply materialize the environment described by its manifest file and immediately be up and running with a known-good set of dependencies.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"1. Introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"Since environments are managed and updated independently from each other, “dependency hell” is significantly alleviated in Pkg. If you want to use the latest and greatest version of some package in a new project but you’re stuck on an older version in a different project, that’s no problem – since they have separate environments they can just use different versions, which are both installed at the same time in different locations on your system. The location of each package version is canonical, so when environments use the same versions of packages, they can share installations, avoiding unnecessary duplication of the package. Old package versions that are no longer used by any environments are periodically “garbage collected” by the package manager.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"1. Introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"Pkg’s approach to local environments may be familiar to people who have used Python’s virtualenv or Ruby’s bundler. In Julia, instead of hacking the language’s code loading mechanisms to support environments, we have the benefit that Julia natively understands them. In addition, Julia environments are “stackable”: you can overlay one environment with another and thereby have access to additional packages outside of the primary environment. This makes it easy to work on a project, which provides the primary environment, while still having access from the REPL to all your usual dev tools like profilers, debuggers, and so on, just by having an environment including these dev tools later in the load path.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"1. Introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"Last but not least, Pkg is designed to support federated package registries. This means that it allows multiple registries managed by different parties to interact seamlessly. In particular, this includes private registries which can live behind corporate firewalls. You can install and update your own packages from a private registry with exactly the same tools and workflows that you use to install and manage official Julia packages. If you urgently need to apply a hotfix for a public package that’s critical to your company’s product, you can tag a private version of it in your company’s internal registry and get a fix to your developers and ops teams quickly and easily without having to wait for an upstream patch to be accepted and published. Once an official fix is published, however, you can just upgrade your dependencies and you'll be back on an official release again.","category":"page"}]
