A package name of Tkinter.jl would only be appropriate if the package used Python's library to accomplish its work or was spearheaded by the same community of developers.\nIt's okay to name a package HTTP.jl even though it is unrelated to the popular rust crate http because in most usages the name \"http\" refers to the hypertext transfer protocol, not to the http rust crate.\nIt's okay to name a package OpenSSL.jl if it provides an interface to the OpenSSL library, even without explicit affiliation with the creators of the OpenSSL (provided there's no copyright or trademark infringement etc.)\nPackages should follow the Stylistic Conventions.\nThe package name should begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown with upper camel case\nPackages that provide the functionality of a project from another language should use the Julia convention\nPackages that provide pre-built libraries and executables can keep their original name, but should get _jllas a suffix.

Introduction","category":"page","text":"Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages, Pkg is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared and selected by name. The exact set of packages and versions in an environment is captured in a manifest file which can be checked into a project repository and tracked in version control, significantly improving reproducibility of projects. If you’ve ever tried to run code you haven’t used in a while only to find that you can’t get anything to work because you’ve updated or uninstalled some of the packages your project was using, you’ll understand the motivation for this approach. In Pkg, since each project maintains its own independent set of package versions, you’ll never have this problem again. Moreover, if you check out a project on a new system, you can simply materialize the environment described by its manifest file and immediately be up and running with a known-good set of dependencies."},{"page":"1. Introduction","location":"","title":"1. Introduction","category":"page","text":"Since environments are managed and updated independently from each other, “dependency hell” is significantly alleviated in Pkg. If you want to use the latest and greatest version of some package in a new project but you’re stuck on an older version in a different project, that’s no problem – since they have separate environments they can just use different versions, which are both installed at the same time in different locations on your system. The location of each package version is canonical, so when environments use the same versions of packages, they can share installations, avoiding unnecessary duplication of the package. Old package versions that are no longer used by any environments are periodically “garbage collected” by the package manager."},{"page":"1. Introduction","location":"","title":"1. Introduction","category":"page","text":"Pkg’s approach to local environments may be familiar to people who have used Python’s virtualenv or Ruby’s bundler. In Julia, instead of hacking the language’s code loading mechanisms to support environments, we have the benefit that Julia natively understands them. In addition, Julia environments are “stackable”: you can overlay one environment with another and thereby have access to additional packages outside of the primary environment. This makes it easy to work on a project, which provides the primary environment, while still having access from the REPL to all your usual dev tools like profilers, debuggers, and so on, just by having an environment including these dev tools later in the load path."},{"page":"1.

If you urgently need to apply a hotfix for a public package that’s critical to your company’s product, you can tag a private version of it in your company’s internal registry and get a fix to your developers and ops teams quickly and easily without having to wait for an upstream patch to be accepted and published.

This package will be available by using the import and using keywords in the Julia REPL, and if the current project is a package, also inside that package.\n\nIf the active environment is a package (the Project has both name and uuid fields) compat entries will be added automatically with a lower bound of the added version.\n\nTo add as a weak dependency (in the [weakdeps] field) set the kwarg target=:weakdeps. To add as an extra dep (in the [extras] field) set target=:extras.\n\nResolution Tiers\n\nPkg resolves the set of packages in your environment using a tiered algorithm. The preserve keyword argument allows you to key into a specific tier in the resolve algorithm. The following table describes the argument values for preserve (in order of strictness):\n\nValue Description\nPRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED Like PRESERVE_ALL and only add those already installed\nPRESERVE_ALL Preserve the state of all existing dependencies (including recursive dependencies)\nPRESERVE_DIRECT Preserve the state of all existing direct dependencies\nPRESERVE_SEMVER Preserve semver-compatible versions of direct dependencies\nPRESERVE_NONE Do not attempt to preserve any version information\nPRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED Like PRESERVE_TIERED except PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED is tried first\nPRESERVE_TIERED Use the tier that will preserve the most version information while\n allowing version resolution to succeed (this is the default)\n\nnote: Note\nTo change the default strategy to PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED set the env var JULIA_PKG_PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED to true.\n\nAfter the installation of new packages the project will be precompiled. For more information see pkg> ?precompile.\n\nWith the PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED strategy the newly added packages will likely already be precompiled, but if not this may be because either the combination of package versions resolved in this environment has not been resolved and precompiled before, or the precompile cache has been deleted by the LRU cache storage (see JULIA_MAX_NUM_PRECOMPILE_FILES).\n\ncompat: Julia 1.9\nThe PRESERVE_TIERED_INSTALLED and PRESERVE_ALL_INSTALLED strategies requires at least Julia 1.9.\n\ncompat: Julia 1.11\nThe target kwarg requires at least Julia 1.11.\n\nExamples\n\nPkg.add(\"Example\") # Add a package from registry\nPkg.add(\"Example\", target=:weakdeps) # Add a package as a weak dependency\nPkg.add(\"Example\", target=:extras) # Add a package to the `[extras]` list\nPkg.add(\"Example\"; preserve=Pkg.PRESERVE_ALL) # Add the `Example` package and strictly preserve existing dependencies\nPkg.add(name=\"Example\", version=\"0.3\") # Specify version; latest release in the 0.3 series\nPkg.add(name=\"Example\", version=\"0.3.1\") # Specify version; exact release\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl\", rev=\"master\") # From url to remote gitrepo\nPkg.add(url=\"/remote/mycompany/juliapackages/OurPackage\") # From path to local gitrepo\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/Company/MonoRepo\", subdir=\"juliapkgs/Package.jl)\") # With subdir\n\nAfter the installation of new packages the project will be precompiled.
